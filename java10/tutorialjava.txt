How we take input and Show Output in Java from CUI application?


CUI application means Character user interface JAVA Provide System class to manage Input and Output Operation using CUI.


java.lang:-

java is the base package and lang is the subpackage of java.

it is the default package of java means it will be linked automatically in java program.


Object:-  it is the super class of Java.all predefine classes of Java will be inherited by Object class.

System:- it is the predefine class of java which is used to handle input /output operation for CUI application.


PrintStream:- it is the subclass of System class which is used to handle Output data of CUI application .

it has two different method

1 print():- display output in single line

2 println():- display output in new line


out:-  it is the reference of PrintStream Class to access print() and println()


InputStream:-  it is used to take input from user's by keyboard

it contain read()

read():-  it return data in byte pattern for single char hence read() never use for input operation.

byte a = System.in.read();

it throw exception hence it is most complicated method.

Java Provide Scanner class to manage input data.

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);


in:-  it is the reference of InputStream class which is used to handle input data from keyboard.

we always use System.in for input operation.
