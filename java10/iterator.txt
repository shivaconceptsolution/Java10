Iterator and Listiterator?
.........................................................................................................

these interfaces is used to show collection data.if collection collection large set of items than foreach loop will take more time to process hence iterator and listiterator interfaces has implemented.



Iterator:-

this interface is used to display the record of LIST Classes and Set Classes object in forward direction.




ListIterator:-

this interface is used to display the record of list classes and set classes in forward and reverse direction both.

what is generic collection classes:-

it is used to provide type safty to collection classes.
because we can specify datatype under collection class object.




ArrayList obj = new ArrayList(); //non generic

ArrayList<Integer> obj = new ArrayList<Integer>();  //generic

ArrayList<Student> obj = new ArrayList<Student>();  //generic arraylist for student type

Comparable and Comparator interface.


Comparable :-

this interface is used to compare object data and sort List classes object.

When we create generic list classes than we always override comparable interface.


Comparator interface:-

this interface is used to compare two different object and provide generic treeset record in ascending order.

when we want to implement generic treeset than comparator interface must be implemented.
